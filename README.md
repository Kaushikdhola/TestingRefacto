# TestingRefacto
This project, "Refactoring GitHub Bot with the use of the LLM model," aims to automate code refactoring within GitHub repositories. By utilizing git hooks, the bot captures pull request details, performs refactoring in the modified code, and submits the optimized code to a new branch, automatically generating a pull request.

## About the this repo
This repository is designed for in-depth exploration of pull requests and branch details within GitHub repositories. The testing mainly revolves around detailed examination and experimentation with these aspects.

## Project Objectives

- **Automated Refactoring:** The primary goal is to automate the refactoring process triggered by git hooks, reducing code redundancy and improving code quality.
- **LLM Model Integration:** Leveraging the power of the LLM model to intelligently suggest and perform code refactoring.
- **Dashboard for Code Statistics:** A dashboard is provided to display every code change, modification, and statistics highlighting improvements in code quality, reduced redundancy, and code smells.

## Key Features

- **Pull Request Details:** The bot collects and analyzes pull request details.
